# [English transcription]

*Amāninā mānadena, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*, we should take resort to *kīrtana* always, but our attitude should be such. Mahāprabhu recommends, *tṛṇād api sunīcena, taror api sahiṣṇunā, amāninā mānadena*. But generally upwards, *tṛṇād api sunīcena, taror api sahiṣṇunā, amāninā mānadena*. We will be, our attitude will be humble, all towards high. And if we think that we are being done wrong, still also we should take to patience, *amāni*. Under no circumstances we shall work for our own position and prestige. That should not be our aim, from above, *amāninā mānadena*. And we shall try to respect everybody. It is all, mostly connected towards upper world. *Tṛṇād api sunīcena, taror api sahiṣṇunā*. Towards Vaiṣṇava world, our conduct will be always like that. Then only we can thrive well in our campaign.

Slow and steady wins the race. It is a long journey, not a journey to finish within a few hours or a few days or a few years; a continued appointment. It is to go on a long way. So we have to adjust accordingly. Not that we should run quickly and then we shall stop and sleep. It is not a matter of that type. It is a long way we will have to walk on. And so our attitude will be such, then we will be successful, *tṛṇād api sunīcena*. No cause, we should not extend any cause for resistance, which will create resistance. Won’t create such circumstance that invites resistance; *tṛṇād api sunīcena.* Still if any resistance unexpectedly approach me, I shall try my best to forebear, being conscious that my guardian’s eye is over me. He is also eager to help me in my campaign. I am not alone. So I may make, or go on confidently, that there is person above to redress the wrong that can be shown to me. So I may not take initiative in the beginning. *Sahiṣṇunā, amāninā,* no other object will come and pollute my aim, my pure purpose of my life. I won’t allow…

… *amāninā*, that *pratiṣṭhā* will come, or any other temptation will come and induce me to go away, I won’t, I should never allow any other but the satisfaction of Guru, Gaurāṅga, and Kṛṣṇa, etc, Vaiṣṇava. No other element can enter there in my purpose. The purity of purpose should always be maintained very scrupulously. *Amāninā mānadena*, and I won’t shrink to give proper conduct, to show proper conduct to my environment. That is, I won’t expect that they will come and help me; I must not very eagerly, *amāninā mānadena*, “Why they are not coming to help me?” No such mentality. They are engaged in their own business. It is my own. Alone I shall go on with my duty. I won’t be always searching that someone must come and help me, *mānadena*. They are doing, let them do their own duty. It is mine; I shall go alone with, *amāninā mānadena, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ*. With this attitude we shall go on.

[Kṛṣṇa ye baratar?]

Our, my concentration only with this sort of adjustment may be more and more intense. My confidence in Kṛṣṇa will be more and more increased. And my duty will be purer, if I couch myself in such a way, *kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ. Hari kīrtana, Hari kīrtana*. Also it will make us to be conscious that such sort of hindrances, obstacles, is almost sure to come to attack you. So already you are given this instruction. Whenever you begin your work, all these things will come to attack you. But you’ve already been given this instruction. So if they come in your way; and almost sure they will come, you are to deal with them in such a way.

Gaura Haribol. Gaura Haribol. Gaura Haribol.

*Hari kīrtana*, the life is not very comfortable, a life of comfort.
