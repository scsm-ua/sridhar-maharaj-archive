# Shri Dayita Das Pranati Panchakam

    bhayabhanjana jayashamsana-karunayata-nayanam

    kanakotpala janakojjvala-rasasagara-chayanam
    mukharikrita-dharanitala-harikirttana-rasanam
    kshitipavana-bhavatarana-pihitaruna-vasanam

    pranamami cha charanantika-paricharaka-sahitam

(1) He (of divine form) came forth from the birthplace of the golden lotus – the ocean of the mellow of divine consorthood. His large, merciful eyes dispel (the suffering souls’) fear and proclaim (the surrendered souls’) victory. His tongue (constantly) vibrates the whole Earth planet with Shri Krishna-*sankirttan*, his beauty resplendent in the robes of the sun’s radiance (saffron) that purifies the universe and dispels the suffering of material existence. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Shri Vrishabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

    shubhadodaya-divase vrisharavija-nija-dayitam
    pranamami cha charanantika-paricharaka-sahitam

(2) The devotees surrendered in pure devotion are eternally protected at his lotus feet. He is worshippable by the pure souls endowed with sincerity and good fortune, and he accepts (even) those who obstruct the service of Shri Hari, just to rectify them. As the very fountainhead of mercy upon all mobile and immobile beings, he crushes the inauspiciousness of the whole universe. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Shri Vrishabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

    atidaivata-mativaishnava-yati-vaibhava-purusham
    sasanatana-raghurupaka-paramanugacharitam
    suvicharaka iva jivaka iti sadhubhiruditam
    shubhadodaya-divase vrisharavija-nija-dayitam
    pranamami cha charanantika-paricharaka-sahitam

(3) Like a miracle, his body moves with a joyful elegance and charm beyond the world’s understanding, fulfilling the artist’s aspiration. (Or, dancing in pastimes transcendental to the world, his artistic form incites divine love’s hankering). His intellect surpasses that of (even) the demigods, and he is nobility incarnate as the commander in-chief of the Vaishnava *sannyasis*(*tridandi-yatis*). The *sadhus* of profound intellect describe the nature of his personality as meticulously in the line of Shri Sanatan, Shri Rupa, and Shri Raghunath, and they speak of him as being on the same plane as Shri Jivapada (being superbly replete in perfect theistic conclusions). On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Shri Vrishabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

    lalitamukha-lalanakula-paramadarayajanam
    vrajakanana-bahumanana-kamalapriyanayanam
    gunamanjari-garima-guna-harivasanavayanam
    shubhadodaya-divase vrisharavija-nija-dayitam
    pranamami cha charanantika-paricharaka-sahitam

(4) On the bank of Shri Radha Kunda at Svananda Sukhada Kunja, he is devoted to the service of his Beloved, and (furthermore) he is greatly endeared to the divine damsels of Braja headed by Lalita. He is most favourite to Kamala-manjari who is pre-eminent in Vrindavan, and with the glorious qualities of Guna-manjari he builds the residence of Shri Hari. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Shri Vrishabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.

    vimalotsavam amalotkala-purushottama-jananam
    patitoddhriti-karunastriti-kritanutana-pulinam
    mathurapura-purushottama-samagaurapuratanam
    harikamaka-haridhamaka-harinamaka-ratanam
    shubhadodaya-divase vrisharavija-nija-dayitam
    pranamami cha charanantika-paricharaka-sahitam

(5) He is immaculate joy incarnate, or, he is the graciousness or the joy of Vimala Devi. He manifested the pastimes of his Advent at Purushottama Kshetra in the holy land of Orissa, and he revealed his pastimes of delivering the fallen souls and extending his mercy upon them (by awarding them the gift of divine love) at the ‘new isles’, or Nabadwip. Circumambulating Gaura Dham in the same way as traditionally done at Braja Dham and Purushottama Dham, he continuously propagates – the loving desire of Braja, the divine abode of Vaikuntha, and the holy Name of Krishna. On his Holy Day of Advent, I (again and again) bow down unto that beloved associate of Shri Vrishabhanunandini, and the servitors of his lotus feet.
