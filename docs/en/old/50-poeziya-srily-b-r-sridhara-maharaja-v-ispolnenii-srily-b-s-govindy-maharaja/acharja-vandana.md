# Āchāryya vandana

    jayare jayare jaya paramahaṁsa mahāśay
    śrī bhaktisiddhānta sarasvatī
    gosvāmī ṭhākura jaya parama koruṇāmoy
    dīnahīna agatira gati

(1) All glories, all glories to the topmost personality, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Saraswatī Goswāmī Ṭhākur, who is an ocean of mercy and the only resort for the fallen souls.

    nilāchale hoiyā uday
    śrī gauḍamaṇḍale āsi’ prema bhakti parakāśi’
    jivera nāśilā bhava-bhay

(2) He made his advent in Śrī Nilāchala, Śrī Puri Dhām. He came to the holy Dhām of Mahāprabhu, manifesting the line of pure devotion and destroying the fear of material life of the conditioned souls.

    tomāra mahimā gāi heno sādhya mora nāi
    tobe pāri jodi deho śakti
    viśvahite avirata āchāra-prachāre rata
    viśuddha śrī rūpānuga bhakti

(3) I have no capacity to sing your glories. Only if you empower me can I do so. You are travelling unceasingly all over India, practising and preaching in a dedicated way, the pure and genuine line of devotion in the current of Śrīla Rūpa Goswāmī.

    śrīpāṭ khetari dhāma ṭhākura śrī narottama
    tomāte tā̐hāra guṇa dekhi
    śāstrera siddhānta-sāra śuni lāge chamatkāra
    kutārkika dite nāre phā̐ki

(4) We see your qualities are like Śrīla Narottam Dās Ṭhākur who in the festival at Kheturi Dhām delivered all the wonderful conclusions of the Scriptures which defeated the unfair argument and deception of the scholars there.

    śuddha bhakti-mata jata upadharma-kavalita
    heriyā lokera mone trāsa
    hāni’ susiddhānta-vāṇa upadharma khāna
    khāna sajjanera vāḍāle ullāsa

(5) By presenting the line of pure devotion he devoured the path of unscriptural practice, and seeing this everybody was afraid. He struck this unscriptural path leaving it in pieces, giving increasing joy to all honest and noble men.

    smārttamata jaladhara śuddha bhakti robi-kara
    āchādila bhāviyā antare
    śāstra sindhu manthanete susiddhānta jhañjhāvāte
    uḍāilā dig digantare

(6) Pure devotion is like the sun risen in the heart, while the path of logic is like clouds covering that sun. By churning the ocean of the Scriptures, you spread perfect conclusions in all directions like a hurricane to disperse the clouds.

    sthāne sthāne koto moṭh sthāpiyācha niṣkapoṭ
    prema sevā śikhāite jīve
    moṭhera vaiṣṇava goṇ kore sadā vitaroṇ
    hari guṇa-kathāmṛta bhave

(7) You founded many temples in many places without reservation, teaching the fallen souls service in divine love. In these temples the Vaiṣṇavas constantly distribute talks on the nectarean qualities of the Supreme Lord Hari.

    śuddha-bhakti-mandākinī vimala pravāha āni
    śitala korilā taptaprāṇa
    deśe deśe niṣkiñchan prerilā vaiṣṇava goṇ
    vistārite hariguṇa gāna

(8) The current of pure devotion descends like the flow of the Ganges, cooling the fire of suffering of material life. Similarly, you sent the Vaiṣṇavas from place to place, widely distributing and chanting the qualities of Lord Hari.

    pūrvve jathā gaurahari māyāvāda cheda kori
    vaiṣṇava korilā kāśivāsī
    vaiṣṇava darśana-sukṣma vichāre tumi he dakṣa
    temati toṣilā vārāṇasī

(9) Just as in the past, Lord Gaurahari severed the *māyāvāda* conception, converting the residents of Vārāṇasī into Vaiṣṇavas, similarly by expert analysis of the Vaiṣṇava philosophy you have enraptured all in Vārāṇasī.

    daiva-varṇāśrama-dharma hari bhakti jāra marma
    śāstra jukte korilā-niśchoy
    jñana-joga-karma choy mūlya tāra kichu noy
    bhaktira virodhī jodi hoy

(10) You showed that certainly devotion to Lord Hari at the core of *daiva-varṇāśrama-dharma*, is the directive of the revealed Scriptures, while knowledge, yoga and material activities, if averse to such devotion are of absolutely no value.

    śrī gauḍamaṇḍala bhūmi bhakta saṅge parikrami
    sukīrtti sthāpilā mahāśoy
    abhinna braja maṇḍala gauḍabhūmi premojvala
    prachāra hoilo viśvamoy

(11) You founded *parikramā* of Śrī Gauḍa Maṇḍala, Śrī Nabadwīp Dhām in the association of the devotees, showing your glories as a great devotee. You showed the whole world the nectarean blissful nature of Śrī Gauḍa Maṇḍala and how it is non-different from Śrī Braja Maṇḍala, Śrī Vṛndāvan.

    kuliyāte pāṣaṇḍīrā atyāchāra koilo jā’rā
    tā sabāra doṣa kṣomā kori
    jagate koile ghoṣaṇā ‘taroriva sahiṣṇunā’
    hon ‘kīrttanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ’

(12) You forgave all the atheists of Kuliyā village, despite their blasphemous behaviour. Loudly you proclaimed to one and all, one who is more tolerant than a tree can chant the glories of Lord Hari endlessly.

    śrī viśva-vaiṣṇava-rāja sabhā-madhye ‘pātrarāja’
    upādhi-bhūṣaṇe vibhūṣita
    viśvera maṅgala lāgi’ hoiyācho sarvva’ tyāgī
    viśvavāsī jon-hite rata

(13) In the grand assembly of Vaiṣṇava kings you are adorned with the title ‘Pātrarāj’, as the head of the assembly. For the benefit of the whole world, you have renounced everything and devoted yourself to the good of all.

    koritecho upakāra jāte para upakāra
    lobhe jīva śrī kṛṣṇa-sevāya
    dūre jāya bhava-roga khaṇḍe jāhe karma bhoga
    hari pāda padma jā’te pāya

(14) You untiringly perform benevolent works just to help the souls of this world to attain the service of Lord Śrī Krishna. Then the disease of material suffering would leave them, their bondage to fruitive works would break and they would attain the lotus feet of the Lord.

    jīva moha-nidrā gata jāgā’te vaikuṇṭha dūta
    ‘gauḍīya’ pāṭhāo ghore ghore
    uṭhore uṭhore bhāi āro to samoya nāi
    ‘kṛṣṇa bhaja’ bole uchaiḥsvare

(15) Seeing the souls of this world sleeping in illusion, you are sending the ‘Gauḍīya’ magazine from door to door just like a messenger from the transcendental plane. It calls aloud, “Awake, arise, O brother, there is no more time to waste, serve and worship your Lord, Śrī Krishna.”

    tomāra mukhāravinda-vigalita makaranda
    siñchita achyuta-guṇa-gāthā
    śunile juḍāya prāṇa tamo moha antardhāna
    dūre jāya hṛdoyera vyathā

(16) Hearing the nectarean verses of the glorious qualities of the infallible Lord Krishna, issuing from your lotus mouth soothes our souls, dissipates our ignorance and illusion, and the pain in our hearts goes far away.

    jāni āmi mahāśoy jaśovāñchā nāhi hoy
    bindu mātra tomāra antare
    tava guṇa vīṇādhārī, mora kaṇṭha-vīṇā dhori’
    avaśete bolāya āmāre

(17) O great soul! I know that there is no trace of desire for fame in your heart. Your qualities, like an expert musician, take hold of the *vīṇā* of my voice and make me speak, devoid of any power over myself.

    vaiṣṇavera guṇa-gāna korile jīvera trāṇa
    śuniyāchi sādhu guru mukhe
    kṛṣṇa bhakti-samudoy janama saphala hoy
    e bhava-sāgara tore sukhe

(18) I have heard from the great saints and Gurus mouths that upon hearing the qualities of the Vaiṣṇava saints, the conditioned souls attain liberation. And beyond this, devotion to Krishna develops, makes the soul’s birth perfect and the soul crosses this material ocean happily with ease.

    te-kāraṇe prayāsa jathā vāmanera āśa
    gaganera chā̐da dhori bāre
    adoṣa-daraśī tumi adhama patita āmi
    nija guṇe kṣomivā āmāre

(19) For this reason I endeavour thus, just like a dwarf aspiring to reach the moon. I am lowly and fallen, but your nature is not to consider any offence, so I beg you to pardon my flaws.

    śrī gaurāṅga-pāriṣada ṭhākura bhaktivinoda
    dīnahīna patitera bandhu
    kali-tamaḥ vināśite ānilena avanīte
    toma’ akalaṅka pūrṇa indu

(20) Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākur, the associate of Śrī Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu and friend of the lowly fallen souls brought you here, and you came like a spotless full moon to dispel the ignorance of this age of Kali.

    koro kṛpā vitaraṇa premasudhā anukṣaṇa
    mātiyā uṭhuka jīva goṇ
    harināma-saṅkīrttane nāchuka jagata-jane
    vaiṣṇava-dāsera nivedan

(21) So please keep incessantly showering your mercy, the nectar of ecstatic love of Godhead, and let all the souls of this world be uplifted by that. May all the people of the world dance in the congregational chanting of the Lord’s Holy Name — this is the prayer of this servant of the Vaiṣṇavas.
