# 1983.11.07.В2.С Search for Sri Krishna Is the Highest Goal of Humanity

*#00:00:00#*

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:**\
Attraction, that is the most fundamental element everywhere. All else can be eliminated, ignored, forgotten, if we come in the touch of attraction, love. Everything can be ignored if we are in connection with love.

Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari.

The fulfillment of our existence, all the existence, everything is in love. Love is the principle in the center, which is the only fulfillment of everything, every existence. The very gist of existence is there, can’t be ignored or challenged by any other forms or aspect of our substantial existence. Unchallengeable, absolute. Absolute king. Absolute king, emperor, is love. None can stand in comparison with that. All will have to accept defeat coming in clash with that principle of love.

Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna. Gaura Hari.

*#00:02:14#*

Mahaprabhu pointed out the thing. There is the most substantial thing in this world. Whatever we see and find and experience and come in connection with, the most central necessity and fulfilment is there, love. Bhagavatam, it draws the extract from the whole of the revealed scriptures and says that love divine, that is the most desirable original entity. We must not allow ourselves to run hither and thither, searching for our base fulfillment, this thing, that thing, so many other things. But forcibly taking our attention, concentrate you in this line, this is the…

[record break, end of side]

*#00:03:31#*

…highest in the creation meant for you, in the eternity. So, give up your wild goose-chasing habit and collect and concentrate all your might to progress in this line, to try to go to the temple of love divine.

Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna, Gaura Hari.

What’s the time?

Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari. Gaura Hari.

*#00:04:35#*

**āsām aho caraṇa-reṇu-juṣām ahaṁ syāṁ**\
**vṛndāvane kim api gulma-latauṣadhīnām**\
**yā dustyajaṁ sva-janam ārya-pathaṁ ca hitvā**\
**bhejur mukunda-padavīṁ śrutibhir vimṛgyām**[^sdfootnote1sym] [SB 10.47.61]

sva-janam ārya-pathaṁ ca hitvā. Risk. The background of risk, that also enhances mood. A necessary part of the highest form of love, to risk the so-called achievement, worldly achievement. The standard of so much so-called purity ever found in this world, at the risk of that, the quest of love divine. That is, that commands the highest position.

Krsna, Krsna.

*#00:06:41#*

Very carefully that should be taken. The line of Newton. The greatest knower of everything, he says “I know nothing”. That is the way. As much as one is [in the midst?] of purity, so much he thinks that “I am impure.” That is the nature of infinite measurement. Measurement [indistinct]. Because the charm is so infinite, it cannot but be estimated in that way. The more they achieve, the more they thirst. Thirst, more earnestness. Realization towards infinite is of that characteristic. As much as one can progress, so much he thinks himself to be helpless, to go farther [for measurement?]. It does not come into the plane of measurement. Nothing.

Krsna, Krsna, Krsna.

Nitai, Nitai, Nitai.

*#00:09:13#*

**mūkaṁ karoti vācālaṁ**\
**paṅguṁ laṅghayate girim**\
**yat-kṛpā tam ahaṁ vande**

We cannot understand, we cannot find ourselves qualified to give any expression about that, so we become dumb. [indistinct] What shall they say? But He makes us open mouth, to open our mouth. Otherwise, the reader, the knower, he becomes dumb. A bona fide searching person becomes dumb with His ways. Cannot give any expression to that. But the power from high comes to make him give some statement. In that way the truth from that part comes here.

mūkaṁ karoti vācālaṁ, they begin to say, give vent to their feeling, pressed by the higher plane, entity. paṅguṁ laṅghayate girim, he has got no power of his own that he can walk, but His wonderful power can help him to cross the mountains. yat-kṛpā, this is the nature of the grace of the almighty, of the absolute. By His power, everything can move, live.

*#00:11:35#*

**yato vā imāni [bhūtāni] jāyante**\
**yena jātāni jīvanti yat prayanty abhisaṁviśanti**[^sdfootnote2sym] [Tait.Up. 3.1.1]

The cause of production, the cause of sustenance. Production, sustenance and again withdrawn. Evolution and dissolution, and sustenance in the middle. The prime cause, universal cause.

    yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante
    yena jātāni jīvanti yat prayanty abhisaṁviśanti

prayanty abhisaṁviśanti. Twice, this is repetition. Superficially repetition: *yat prayanty,* towards whom, then abhisaṁviśanti, and finally enters. At the time of dissolution, that is [sṛṣṭira?] saṁhāra, everything disappears into the subtle existence, at the wholesale dissolution of this world. But again with the evolution, they come out. And abhisaṁviśanti, they enter into the lila, permanent lila. They do not come back into this world of exploitation and renunciation.

*#00:13:38#*

**tad vijijñāsasva**

Inquire after him. What do you do? Make inquiry where you are. Where you are, and enquiry must have such broad form. Making enquiry always, but what type of thing? But give a wide, widest shape of your enquiry. Where you are? Who are you? Where you are? How you are to go? This is our dire necessity for our own purpose.

*#00:14:31#*

We can’t avoid. And that enquiry contains, we can’t predict level of thought. Brahman, Paramatma, Bhagavan. So Bhagavan enquiry that is the highest, search for Sri Krsna, Reality the Beautiful. A natural necessity within us, for our own interest, can’t avoid. A sane man, a man who does not want to deceive him, he can’t avoid search for Krsna, for his own best benefit, the most general thing of our nature. To enquire for happiness, *raso vai saḥ*. Enquire for our best comfort. This is the general question. This should be the only question of the whole animation. Search for Sri Krsna. Searching, searching for love, ecstasy, the highest form of ecstasy.

*#00:15:53#*

Redeem the crime… What have I done? What is my necessity, and how I am passing my days? Repent, cry. I have passed my days uselessly, I am a traitor to my own self, I am committing suicide. I am going to commit suicide. Complain against yourself, and your so-called friends.

*#00:16:40#*

We have nothing to do here. [Read and cry?], do or die! Progress in the right way, or you are inviting your death. The general tenor of life, of all existence, will be this. In the most scientific way, search for Sri Krsna, Reality of the Beautiful. That is the ever-found highest goal of humanity, not only, but all animation. And all problems are combined here. All problems, they are all harmonized, all the problems. So no complaint against this attempt. Can be normal. Deviation from this general instruction, the general call, all false, unnecessary and [ill-doing, what is this?], injurious. So this is the truth, the necessity of everyone, wherever there is animation.

*#00:18:41#*

The most generalized march, call for such march. Most grand and extensive and friendly. Friendly call to the all, to the whole of the world, the only call, ‘March towards Krsna!’ The only call. All should be silenced. All other topics should be silenced, should be stopped, and only if this call remains, the real welfare of the world remains. Everything becomes

**tasmin jñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ [bhavati]**\
**tasmin prāpte sarvam idaṁ prāptam bhavati**[^sdfootnote3sym] [Mund.Up. 1.3]

[indistinct] So comprehensive call.

Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari.

*#00:19:57#*

No sectarianism is here. Apparently it is thought sectarian by the abnormal thinking. But every normal thinking, that is the most general, universal thing you are dealing with. Search for Sri Krishna, march towards the divine domain, universal march towards divine domain. Save yourself, back to home, back to God, back to Godhead. Call. Back to home.

*#00:21:07#*

We are quarreling is the foreign land for fictitious gain. Save them, and take them all home. Only by the grace of that absolute it is possible to certain extent. The wave coming from there to take us home. Home-knowing man can only give us such news, and can take us there. The home-knowing man. So the call comes from the home. The origination of this call is from the home.

Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari, Gaura Hari.

I close it.
