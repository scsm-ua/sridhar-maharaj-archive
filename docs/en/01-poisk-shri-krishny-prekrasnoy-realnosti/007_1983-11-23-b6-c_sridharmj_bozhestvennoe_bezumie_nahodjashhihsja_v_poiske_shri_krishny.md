# 007. Divine madness in search for Sri Krishna (1983.11.23.B6.C)

    āmi — eka bātula, tumi — dvitīya bātula
    ataeva tomāya āmāya ha-i sama-tula

Mahaprabhu says. Mahaprabhu says to Sanatana:

“What I talk to you – that is a kind of mania, madness. But you’re a type of madman, I am also so… so, we, you and meself, are of same rank.”

[chuckles]

Talking all these things, this delirium. What we say, it is all delirium to the public. So I am also madman and you are also so, you are giving attendance and I am speaking. All delirium. What value in the so called world of reality these things have got?

Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Gaura Hari.

    bahava iha vihaṅgā bhikṣu-caryāṁ caranti

    yad-anucarita-līlā-karṇa-pīyūṣa-vipruṭ-
    sakṛd-adana-vidhūta-dvandva-dharmā vinaṣṭāḥ
    sapadi gṛha-kuṭumbaṁ dīnam utsṛjya dīnā
    bahava iha vihaṅgā bhikṣu-caryāṁ caranti

Radharani says to Uddhava: “What should we say, Uddhava, to you? Your Master has got such a charm, that coming in connection with Him, everyone becomes mad. Only a slightest drop, a drop of His connection can make everyone mad. The least part of His life, least part, a drop of His activities, any connection can make everyone mad.”

    yad-anucarita-līlā-karṇa-pīyūṣa-vipruṭ-

If enters through the ear, the life nectar, of nectar.

    karṇa-pīyūṣa-vipruṭ,

A drop, smallest drop,

    sakṛd-adana-vidhūta-dvandva-dharmā vinaṣṭāḥ

If anyone has taken, has swallowed only a drop, he is finished.

    dvandva-dharmā

the good or bad, heat or cold, or enemy and friend, or husband and wife—all ties at once dissolved.

    dvandva-dharmā vinaṣṭāḥ

Duality. The love for duality. For any other environment friend. What we find in the midst of, everything dissolves.

    …karṇa-pīyūṣa-vipruṭ-
    sakṛd-adana-vidhūta-dvandva-dharmā vinaṣṭāḥ
    sapadi gṛha-kuṭumbaṁ dīnam utsṛjya dīnā

Then what is the effect, consequence? They have no charm for anything else in the real world, in the environment. Release. From the core of their heart, everything…

    gṛha-kuṭumbaṁ

their friends, their house, family, no charm for anything, leaves at once.

    gṛha-kuṭumbaṁ dīnam

They are also very [indistinct], very poor. Very helpless, but who cares for them? Their wife, their father, their mother, their son, their friends – they become very very very… consider themselves very unfortunate and suffer much.

But this is [indistinct] who has got the connection with Krishna, he does not care for them at all. Nothing.

    …gṛha-kuṭumbaṁ dīnam utsṛjya dīnā
    bahava iha vihaṅgā bhikṣu-caryāṁ caranti

Just like the birds. I got no attraction for any particular tree. Only from this tree to that tree, that tree, that tree, in this way. So Him also, without caring for any comfortable environment, from here, there, here, there, he wanders. Wanders in search of Him.

    bahava iha vihaṅgā bhikṣu-caryāṁ…

A king, giving up his throne, comes on the street and he wants to live on begging. King comes to be a beggar, scholars come to be understood like a madmen, in this way all the position of this world becomes trash to him and he comes out on the street as a beggar, madman, and he is hunting after Him. Where shall I get that kind of taste once more?

Mahaprabhu:

    kāhāṅ kṛṣṇa prāṇa-nātha vrajendra-nandana!
    kāhāṅ yāṅa kāhāṅ pāṅa, muralī-vadana!’

Oh, my friends, if you help me, help in this way: say where should I go? I shall get that…

[record break]

[indistinct] I can’t stand without that taste. You are my friends, [indistinct] what shall I do? I can’t, I can’t remain standing, I can’t live without Him. That is…

Gaura Haribol, Gaura Haribol.

The hankering, the plane of hankering of our heart. Within heart, within consciousness of soul, whatever we may say, the inner plane is of such… Searching, Search for Sri Krishna, Reality the beautiful.

**athāto brahma jijñāsa**, in Vedānta. The substance of the Veda collected and Brahma Sutra was given by Veda Vyasa. And beginning: **athāto brahma jijñāsa**, the most relevant question of all of us in here, **brahma jijñāsa,** search of the biggest. And that has become by Mahaprabhu search for Krishna, search for Krishna. Jijñāsa, inquiry after the biggest, all accommodating thing. Here, the search for Krishna, reality the beautiful.

    kāhāṅ kṛṣṇa

Life is injected into that consciousness, **brahma jijñāsa**. The heart is taking the main part. I can’t stand without the object, the meaning of the Brahma. Who is the creator, who is the sustainer? Who is everything here? I cant stand without Him.

Living thing, **brahma jijñāsa**. That scholarly inquiry towards what is the most basic, fundamental plane where we stand, **brahma jijñāsa**. A house hankering. What for we are living? Fulfillment of our life. Where is fulfillment of our life?

Not that scholarly inquiry: “Why do we stand here? What is the analytical value of the environment?” Not such scholarly investigation, but heart’s inner demand.

What for I live? Whom I [indistinct]? Where is my fulfillment? This…

Gaura-Hari, Gaura, Gauranga has such…

    kāhāṅ kṛṣṇa prāṇa-nātha vrajendra-nandana!
    kāhāṅ yāṅa kāhāṅ pāṅa, muralī-vadana!’

    kāhāre kahiba, kebā jāne mora duḥkha
    vrajendra-nandana vinu phāṭe mora buka

My heart [indistinct] without having this touch.

Gaura Haribol

Finish here today.

Nitai-Gaura Haribol.
