# 1982.07.05.B1 Exclusive Search for Krishna Is Reward of Its Own

*#00:00:00#*

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:** …to get it and what to get, that is at His disposal. So you should be prepared for that. If you like, you may come or you may go other way. That may embrace you or may finish you. Jiva Goswami says like thunder. The chataka, a kind of bird, they only drink the water of the rain and never any water on the surface. They are always with their face upwards: “Phatee jal, oh water, oh water!”. In this way they make noise. But the cloud may send a thunder or drops of pure water for him. With this attitude we are to approach towards Krishna. I may get, may not get, that also may be. But still, to hanker after His connection, that is the highest position. Not… Eliminating all others. *Anyābhilāṣ, karma, jñān.* Elimination of the whole and only to wait for His favor. I may get it, I may not get it. If you like you may come, otherwise go away. This is so dear, so rare. It is Your sweet will. Krishna conception is like that.

*#00:02:04#*

**āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām**\
**adarśanān marma-hatāṁ karotu vā**\
**yathā tathā vā vidadhātu lampaṭo**\
**mat-prāṇa-nāthas tu sa eva nāparaḥ**[^sdfootnote1sym]

Whether I get it or not, I admit that that is the highest ideal of life, to aspire after Him. So we are to understand, scrutinize, how and what for. Only hankering should be the best aspiration. How it is possible? We may get it, may not get it. Still we must aspire after and that aspiration is our highest goal. How it can be possible? What is in the process, have they not achievement of the fruit? But in the attempt there is such purity that everyone should hanker for that, even without surety that you may get that. What is there in the process that we should adopt for eternity? We are to wait for eternity, may or may not get, still we want that. What is that?

*#00:03:38#*

If you can understand that the beauty in the way of search, that to search for Krishna, that is the highest beauty and nothing else, exclusive search for Krishna, that is reward of its own. Virtue is reward of its own. In that way you are to analyze, think, realize and have your satisfaction. Virtue is its own reward. I am [victorious?] because I want that I will be rewarded, not that. I am virtuous; it is itself is purity. So of all the conception of all the virtues the search for Krishna’s truth, that is the highest virtue. In this way we are to understand what is devotion to Krishna and who is Krishna.

*#00:04:50#*

**Question:** Sometimes people give up aspiring, they reverse position. They say, “I did not get it therefore Krishna’s will is that I do not get it.”

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:** What did he say?

**Question:** Sometimes people give up aspiring for the highest thing. They say “Krishna did not give it to me, therefore… therefore I will go the other way”.

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:** It’s futile. I won’t try that path, that is? Yes, they may go. Yes. [indistinct] And there are so many. Very very rare, we may not achieve. So the big research scholars, what they do? I may be successful or may not be successful. Should I go in this way? You ask them. What they will answer. I may be successful or may not be, but still I want to research this thing. The determination will be like that, the high scholar.

*#00:06:02#*

**Question:** Srila Sridhar Maharaj? Some Shikshas find hope when they see someone has been successful, when they see someone has succeeded, he has reached the goal.

*#00:06:20#*

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:** I don’t follow.

*#00:06:22#*

**Question:** When someone follows the process and is successful in the attempt, he reaches the goal, he gets darshan of Krishna, then that gives hope to others to see that. To see someone who has perfected.

*#00:06:45#*

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:** Someone is successful and they say, «Come and follow me and you’ll be successful.» You say that?

**Question:** Yes.

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:**

    svayaṁ samuttīrya sudustaraṁ dyuman
    bhavārṇavaṁ bhīmam adabhra-sauhṛdāḥ
    …
    nidhāya yātāḥ sad-anugraho bhavān

That is a sloka in Bhagavatam. When they cross this ocean…

**svayaṁ samuttīrya sudustaraṁ dyuman**\
**bhavārṇavaṁ bhīmam adabhra-sauhṛdāḥ**\
**bhavat-padāmbhoruha-nāvam atra te**\
**nidhāya yātāḥ sad-anugraho bhavān**[^sdfootnote2sym]\
[SB 10.2.31]

So many, that is of the lowest conception. So many saints after using Your name, after taking shelter in the service of Your name they have crossed the dreadful ocean of life and death and left that distress. Boat, by the help of the boat of the praise of Your holy feet, they have crossed this ocean of death and birth and again they have left behind that boat for others to go by that way, to cross this. This is only about mukti, taking the name of Krishna to acquire liberation. Example of that here. And what you want to take? Has some already experienced?

*#00:08:40#*

**Question:** No. If someone has attained Krishna Prema, that is the goal, Krishna Prema. Than they gives, they…

*#00:08:55#*

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:** Then they come to distribute that, recruit us, persons, for that.

*#00:08:58#*

**Question:** Then others will be attracted to make the attempt because the goal has been reached by someone. Then the process has been shown to be correct because the goal has been reached. Someone has reached the goal.

*#00:09:14#*

**Srila Bhakti Rakshak Sridhar Dev-Goswami Maharaj:** Yes, if we can go properly then of course we generally can hope that we shall reach the goal. But that does not affect my point. Because it is very rare. I say that it is not so easy to capture the goal. We should not think like that. We have the real conception of the thing and we shall have also at the same time the conception of what is He and what is called to get Him. The getting may not be according to our picture of the present time. Union in separation, we must try to conceive that thing. Try to. Though I do not get, I cannot leave the search. Once search began the right way, then one cannot leave that search. In searching… He is in the searching also about Him. So they can’t leave. The search of Krishna is also Krishna, of a particular type.
